this is a 3D renderer using raytracing made by following the [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book written by Peter Shirley

most of the code in this project comes straight from the book.
I have added comments and some code additions such as making the image rendering multi-threaded.
