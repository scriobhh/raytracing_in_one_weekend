this is a raytracer made by following the [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book written by Peter Shirley

most of the code in this project comes straight from the book, with some small additions by me such as making the image rendering multi-threaded
